March 16, 1994                UUPC/extended license agreement



Terms and Conditions for Copying, Distribution, and Modification

"UUPC/extended", below, refers to the entire UUPC/extended package, as
distributed by Kendra Electronic Wonderworks.  A "work based on
UUPC/extended" means either UUPC/extended or any derivative work under
copyright law:  that is to say, a work containing UUPC/extended or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
into another language.  (Translation is included without limitation in
the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  UUPC/extended may
be installed and run on as many systems as desired without restriction.

1.You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of UUPC/extended's source
  code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
  and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice
  and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to
  this License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other
  recipients of UUPC/extended a copy of this License along with
  UUPC/extended.

  a) You may not distribute versions of UUPC/extended that you know to
     be obsolete.  You are specifically prohibited from knowingly
     distributing obsolete versions of UUPC/extended in order to support
     third party programs.

  b) You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

2.You may modify your copy or copies of UUPC/extended or any portion of
  it, thus forming a work based on UUPC/extended, and copy and
  distribute such modifications or works under the terms of Section 1
  above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  a) The modified files must carry prominent notices stating that you
     changed the files and the date of any change.

  b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
     whole or in part contains or is derived from UUPC/extended or any
     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
     parties under the terms of this License.

  c) You may not make malicious changes to UUPC/extended.  You may not
     insert viruses, worms, or other code intended to damage or disrupt
     the end user's system and/or data.

  d) You may not cripple UUPC/extended's functionality in any way.  In
     particular, you may not make continued use of UUPC/extended
     contingent on payment of a registration fee.

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from UUPC/extended,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections.  Specifically, unique works may interface to UUPC/extended via
configuration, spooling, or other files using routines based on
UUPC/extended source code without falling under the scope of this
License.

It is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on UUPC/extended.

3.You may copy and distribute UUPC/extended (or a work based on it,
  under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
  Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

  a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine- readable
     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
     interchange; or,

  b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years,
     to give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of
     physically performing source distribution, a complete
     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
     customarily used for software interchange; or,

  c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
     distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed
     only for non-commercial distribution and only if you received
     UUPC/extended in object code or executable form with such an offer,
     in accord with Subsection b above.)

  d) Distribution of multiple copies of the object code within a single
     organization is specifically exempted from this section.

The complete UUPC/extended source code means all the source code
for all modules UUPC/extended contains plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However,
UUPC/extended source code does not include any components of
either the operating system under which UUPC/extended runs or the
compiler and runtime libraries used to construct the executable.

4.You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute UUPC/extended
  except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
  otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute UUPC/extended is
  void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
  this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
  parties remain in full compliance.

5.You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
  it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
  distribute UUPC/extended or its derivative works.  These actions are
  prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
  modifying or distributing UUPC/extended (or any work based on
  UUPC/extended), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so,
  and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or
  modifying UUPC/extended or works based on it.

6.Each time you redistribute UUPC/extended (or any work based on
  UUPC/extended), the recipient automatically receives a license from
  the original licenser to copy, distribute or modify UUPC/extended
  subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
  restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
  this License.


NO WARRANTY

7.Because UUPC/extended is licensed free of charge, there is no warranty
  for UUPC/extended, to the extent permitted by applicable law.  Except
  when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other
  parties provide UUPC/extended "as is" without warranty of any kind,
  either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the
  implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular
  purpose.  The entire risk as to the quality and performance of
  UUPC/extended is with you.  Should UUPC/extended prove defective, you
  assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

8.In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing
  will any copyright holder, or any other party who may modify and/or
  redistribute UUPC/extended as permitted above, be liable to you for
  damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential
  damages arising out of the use or inability to use UUPC/extended
  (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered
  inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of
  UUPC/extended to operate with any other programs), even if such holder
  or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
